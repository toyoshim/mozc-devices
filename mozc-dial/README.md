**We've made things well-rounded.**

"Keyboards are boring if you can only type on them."

In response to feedback from our users,

we have created a keyboard that you can turn.

The Gboard Dial Version,

realizing text input by rotation.

## Let's build it

## There's also a non-rotating Gboard

For those who are accustomed to conventional typing input,

we also offer the standard version of Gboard.

It provides a comfortable input experience

in conjunction with various Google services

such as voice input and translation functions.
